# Flight Through Unknown Gap - Drone Navigation Project

![Project Banner](path/to/banner-image.jpg)

## Overview
In November 2023, we successfully engineered a sophisticated perception and control stack enabling a DJI Tello drone to autonomously navigate through gaps of unknown shape and size. This project represents a significant advancement in drone navigation technology, demonstrating the potential for drones to operate in complex and previously unchartered environments.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Gap Navigation:** Engineered to enable a DJI Tello drone to autonomously fly through various gaps without prior knowledge of their dimensions or shapes.
- **Advanced Perception Stack:** Utilized state-of-the-art techniques in optical flow analysis to accurately identify navigable gaps in real-time.
- **Robust and Versatile:** Tested and achieved a 100% success rate in navigating gaps across a range of different environments, showcasing the adaptability and reliability of the system.
